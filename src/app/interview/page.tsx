    title: "What is closure in JavaScript?",
    answer: `A closure is the combination of a function bundled together with references to its surrounding state.
              It gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function.`,
    solution: `You can create closures by defining a function inside another function and returning it.`,
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    title: "What is the event loop?",
    answer: `The event loop is a programming construct that waits for and dispatches events in a program.
              It works by making a request to some internal or external "event provider" and then calls
              the relevant event handler.`,
    solution: `The event loop allows JavaScript to perform non-blocking I/O operations by using callbacks and promises.`,
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    title: "What is the difference between '==' and '==='?",
    answer: `The '==' operator checks for value equality with type coercion, while '===' checks for both value and type equality.`,
    solution: `Use '===' to avoid unexpected results due to type coercion.`,
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    title: "What are promises in JavaScript?",
    answer: `Promises are objects that represent the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.`,
    solution: `You can create a promise using the Promise constructor and handle it with .then() and .catch() methods.`,
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    title: "What is the purpose of 'async' and 'await'?",
    answer: `The 'async' keyword is used to declare an asynchronous function, and 'await' is used to pause the execution until the promise is resolved.`,
    solution: `Use 'async' before a function declaration and 'await' before a promise to handle asynchronous code more easily.`,
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    title: "What is the 'this' keyword in JavaScript?",
    answer: `The 'this' keyword refers to the context in which a function is called, which can vary depending on how the function is invoked.`,
    solution: `Use arrow functions to maintain the context of 'this' from the enclosing scope.`,
  },
  {
    id: 7,
    title: "What is event delegation?",
    answer: `Event delegation is a technique that allows you to attach a single event listener to a parent element to manage events for multiple child elements.`,
    solution: `This improves performance and simplifies event management in dynamic lists.`,
  },
